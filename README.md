## üìñ About

This repository contains my NixOS Linux configuration with the Hyprland window manager. 

I use Nixos with Flakes & Home Manager.

It also includes my config for all my programs, as I use Nix to manage all my config files via home manager.

This includes my Emacs, Firefox, Zsh, and foot terminal configs, as well as configs for programs adjacent to Hyprland such as Waybar, Rofi, dunst, etc. All wrapped up neatly in one NixOS config!

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Reproducible**: Built on NixOS, this configuration can be effortlessly reproduced on other machines, ensuring a consistent setup.

- üñåÔ∏è **Consistent**: Nearly every component has been styled with base16 colors so I can change my base16 theme and all programs are themed in a cohesive way.

- ‚úÖ **Complete**: This system is equipped with a wide range of components and utilities, akin to the completeness of operating systems like MacOS or Windows.

- ü™∂ **Lightweight**: Using only a window manager and lightweight utilities keeps memory usage low and the system unbloated.

- üé® **Customizable**: Leveraging the power of Linux and Hyprland, this configuration offers extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor your setup to your preferences.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download and Install NixOS from the [official site](https://nixos.org/download).
2. Clone the repo, change your system hostname in flake.nix and configuration.nix
3. # Run 'nixos-rebuild --flake .#your-hostname'

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

I try to use Emacs keys as much as possible as it is my favorite software :)

# More

Flake-based NixOS (and home-manager ) configurations for my devices.

These use tmpfs for the root directory, including the home directory, with the impermanence module. Persistent data is organized via btrfs submodules. I use sway as window manager for a graphical environment.

I wrote this mostly from scratch, as an exercise to improve my understanding of the Nix and NixOS ecosystem. Some links that I got help and inspiration from can be found below.


## Notes

### For Visitors

These configurations are obviously meant for my personal use.

However, I strive to structure it well and document options and my decisions extensively via comments (mainly for my own sake, so it's easily maintainable and I won't have to wonder why I did something in a particular way some time in the future, but who knows, it might help other people as well). I also use some potentially interesting custom design patterns and features.

So, this project might be a useful resource if you're working on your own config, so feel free to look through it. If you're just starting with NixOS, I'd suggest you look at <https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs>.
