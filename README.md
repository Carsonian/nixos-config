## üìñ About

This repository contains my NixOS Linux configuration with the Hyprland window manager. 

I use Nixos with Flakes & Home Manager.

It also includes my config for all my programs, as I use Nix to manage all my config files via home manager.

This includes my Emacs, Firefox, Zsh, and foot terminal configs, as well as configs for programs adjacent to Hyprland such as Waybar, Rofi, dunst, etc. All wrapped up neatly in one NixOS config!

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Reproducible**: Built on NixOS, this configuration can be effortlessly reproduced on other machines, ensuring a consistent setup.

- üñåÔ∏è **Consistent**: Nearly every component has been styled with base16 colors so I can change my base16 theme and all programs are themed in a cohesive way.

- ‚úÖ **Complete**: This system is equipped with a wide range of components and utilities, akin to the completeness of operating systems like MacOS or Windows.

- ü™∂ **Lightweight**: Using only a window manager and lightweight utilities keeps memory usage low and the system unbloated.

- üé® **Customizable**: By changing the base16 theme most programs will update to use that colorscheme. Config wise all programs are and can be configured via home manager in one place. 

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download and Install NixOS from the [official site](https://nixos.org/download).
2. Clone the repo, change your system hostname in flake.nix and configuration.nix
3. # Run 'nixos-rebuild --flake .#your-hostname'

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

I try to use Emacs keys as much as possible as it is my favorite software :)

### For Visitors

These configurations are obviously meant for my personal use.

I wrote this mostly from scratch, as an exercise to improve my understanding of the Nix and NixOS ecosystem as well as about linux, window managers and software in general.

However, I try to structure it well and document options and my decisions extensively via comments (mainly for my own sake, so it's easily maintainable and I won't have to wonder why I did something in a particular way some time in the future.).

So, this project might be a useful resource if you're working on your own config, so feel free to look through it, copy whatever you want, steal whatever, anything that helps!

If you're just starting with NixOS, I'd suggest you look at <https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs>.
